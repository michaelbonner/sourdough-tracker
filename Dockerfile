# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# =====================================================================
# Production image for Sourdough Tracker.
#
# Built in GitHub Actions (see .github/workflows/deploy.yml) and pushed to
# GHCR; Dokploy only pulls and runs it. Previously Dokploy built this on the
# production box with railpack, which put a full `next build` on the same
# CPU and RAM as the live site on every push.
#
# Dependencies are installed with bun, because bun.lock is the source of truth
# for this repo. The build and the server then run on Node: bun segfaults
# inside `next build` for some of these apps (verified on both amd64 and
# arm64), and Node is what Next targets anyway.
# =====================================================================
# Both Node stages resolve the same base through one ARG so they cannot drift
# apart, and so there is a single place to pin. Override to pin an exact image:
#   docker build --build-arg NODE_IMAGE=node:22-slim@sha256:<digest> .
ARG BUN_IMAGE=oven/bun:1
ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:22-slim

# `next build` imports server modules to collect route metadata, so anything

#
# `npm run build` rather than `next build` directly, so the package.json build
# script (and any flags it carries) stays the single definition of the build.
